Personal portfolio website developed as part of my computer science coursework at ITIS C. Zuccante.

This website collects programming projects, mathematical simulations, and experiments created during my learning journey in software development and computational problem solving.

The site is built using simple web technologies and is designed to present school projects in a clear and accessible way through GitHub Pages.

## About Me

Hi, I’m Israk Sarker, a high school student specializing in Computer Science and Information Technology at ITIS C. Zuccante.

I am interested in programming, algorithm design, and understanding how mathematical concepts can be implemented through code. My projects mainly focus on:

- learning programming through practical experimentation
- visualizing mathematical concepts
- numerical simulations
- recursion and algorithmic thinking

This portfolio represents part of my academic work and personal exploration while developing programming skills.

## About the Website

This repository contains the source code for my GitHub Pages portfolio website.

The goal of the website is to:

- present school programming projects
- document learning progress
- demonstrate practical applications of theoretical concepts
- provide interactive visual examples of algorithms and simulations

The website is intentionally minimal and lightweight, focusing on functionality and clarity rather than complex design frameworks.

## Projects Included

### Recursive Tree

A graphical experiment that generates a tree structure using recursion.

This project demonstrates:
- recursive algorithms
- geometric transformations
- graphical rendering concepts

### Recursive Triangles

A recursive visualization that creates fractal-like triangle patterns.

Concepts explored:
- recursion depth
- fractal structures
- mathematical pattern generation

### Py Calculator and Pi Approximation

A mathematical simulation project implementing numerical methods to approximate Pi.

Implemented methods include:

#### Monte Carlo Method

Uses random point generation inside a square containing a unit circle.

If:

M = points inside the circle  
N = total generated points

Then:

π ≈ 4 × (M / N)

The accuracy improves as the number of simulations increases.

#### Trapezoidal Method

Approximates Pi using numerical integration of a quarter unit circle defined by:

y = √(1 − x²)

The area under the curve is approximated using trapezoids, demonstrating numerical approximation techniques used in scientific computing.
