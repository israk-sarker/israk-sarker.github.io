                Hi, I am Israk Sarker, a student at ITIS C. Zuccante high school specializing in computer science and software development.<br><br>

                This website collects some of my school projects and experiments created while learning programming concepts such as
                recursion, mathematical simulations, and algorithmic problem solving. My main interests include coding, exploring how
                mathematics can be visualized through programming, and building small interactive applications to better understand
                theoretical concepts studied in class.<br><br>

                The projects shown here are part of my learning journey and demonstrate practical applications of programming logic,
                graphical simulations, and numerical approximation methods. Inside the repository ZIP file you can find the complete
                source code and all related work developed during my coursework.
